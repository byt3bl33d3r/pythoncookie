# PythonCookie

This is my Python [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) project template.

This is the most minimalist & modern Python project setup that I've come up with so far.

Features:
- Uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management & packaging
- Has a Makefile which automates a few tasks I find myself doing all the time
- Includes a Dockerfile/.dockerignore file
- Includes a `.devcontainer` folder to for VSCode
